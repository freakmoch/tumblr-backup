# tumblr-backup

This is a collection of utilities dealing with Tumblr blogs.

- `tumblr_backup.py` makes a local backup of posts and images

More documentation can be found in each script's docstring or in
[tumblr_backup.md](https://github.com/bbolli/tumblr-utils/blob/master/tumblr_backup.md).

### Freakmoch Fork

I've currently forked this to add improvements and a simple bat file for those not familiar with Python.

Its only in work with `tumblr_backup.py` and `xmltramp.py` currently, so other utils were deleted in the process. Please check up with the original source that was forked off for updates and downloads of these tools

If its requested to be deleted I'll do so.

xmltramp.py : http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/xmltramp/
